# Look and motion: broflora beautiful by default

broflora's simulation grows good plants, but what reaches the screen does not
look or move like a tree. This plan adopts what looked best in a search that
built the same valley six ways from code (`../opus-worlds`, a local scratch
repo: `blocks/<id>/`, `gallery/<id>/`, `notes/<id>.md`). The aim is that any app
calling broflora and bro.scene with defaults gets trees, shrubs and grass that
are beautiful standing still and move like plants.

## What looked best, and why

| Quality | Reference | What makes it work |
|---|---|---|
| Trees standing still | volume (`blocks/volume/trees.js`, `sprites.js`, `gallery/volume/r2_*`) | kinked branches (never straight), smooth-unioned bark; the crown is **clumps** of leaf mass with gaps between them, not a uniform spray; a crown envelope gives each point an interior depth, so the crown is dark inside and lit at the rim |
| Tree motion | dense (`blocks/dense/flora.js` `treeBend`, `element.js`) and growth (`blocks/growth/flora.js`) | hierarchical sway: the trunk leans into a **travelling gust** (offset grows with height squared); each limb bobs on its own phase, weighted by branch weight squared (0 on the trunk, 1 at a twig tip); each leaf flutters about its own stem and shows its paler underside; all of it in the vertex shader, nothing on the CPU |
| Lighting a mass of leaves | dense (bulk normals) | each leaf is lit partly by the normal of the mass it belongs to (crown centre outward), plus ao that darkens leaves deep inside: thousands of cards read as one rounded form with a lit side and a shade side; translucency where the sun is behind |
| Grass | dense (`blocks/dense/ground.js`, `flora.js`, `gallery/dense/r2_ground.png`) | dense procedural blades placed from the instance id over tiles around the camera (no per-blade data), lit by the ground's bulk normal, bent by the same travelling gusts, parted by things moving through it |

What did **not** work: volume's trees move as a single blob, because a
volume can only bend as a whole. bro.scene's current wind (`windDelta` in
`src/scene/vulkan/shaders/scene_camera.glsl`) has the same problem: one sine per vertex,
weighted by vertex colour R, with no gusts and no hierarchy.

## Where each piece lives

- **broflora (C++ emit)**: the geometry and the per-vertex data motion and
  lighting need: branch weight, a per-limb phase, the leaf's stem anchor and
  flutter axis, the plant's root and height, the crown centre and radius. Better
  geometry: kinked, smooth-joined branches, leaf clumps, crown interior depth.
- **bro.scene (engine)**: a wind field with travelling gusts, which replaces the
  single sine and stays backward compatible with `setWind`. A vegetation path in
  the mesh/instanced shaders: hierarchical sway, bulk-normal blend, crown ao,
  translucency, a two-sided leaf underside. The same sway runs in the shadow pass.
  A grass node.
- **bromesh**: leaf-card and scatter changes only where the emit needs them.
- **bro.flora JS**: defaults that wire it all up, so the simplest app looks right.
- **broworkshop demos/flora-lab** (or a new grove demo): the showcase and the
  oracle. A grove of grown trees and a meadow on uneven ground at golden hour,
  judged in motion against the reference galleries.

## Step 1 as built: the vegetation records

broflora computes one `SegmentSway` per segment (`emitPlantSway` /
`emitWorldSway`, `include/broflora/mesh_emit.h` "Wind sway") and every
geometry emitter turns it into **vegetation records**, the data bro.scene's
vegetation shaders (`src/scene/vulkan/shaders/scene_vegetation.glsl`) sway in
the scene's wind field. Per vertex (`MeshData::vegetation`, bromesh) or per
instance a record is 16 floats in the emit's space:

| Floats | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0-3 | root.xyz, height: the plant's origin and height above it |
| 4-7 | crown.xyz, crownRadius: the leaf-mass weighted crown centre and the farthest leafy segment end from it; radius 0 on wood (no bulk normal) |
| 8-11 | anchor.xyz, branch weight: a leaf's or bloom's attachment point on its segment, or a bark vertex's skeleton point; the weight there |
| 12-15 | axis.xyz, phase: a leaf's stem (tip) direction, zero on wood (no flutter); the limb's phase |

Per segment (the GPU tube and scatter paths) it is 12 floats: root.xyz,
height, crown.xyz, crownRadius, weightFrom, weightTo, phase, 0.

| Emitter | Records |
|---|---|
| `emitPlantMesh` / `emitWorldMesh` (`bakeVegetation`) | per bark vertex, wood, the weight at its ring |
| leaf meshes (JS `emitFoliageMesh`, `emitPlantFoliageMesh`; C++ `leafVegetation` over `LeafPlacements::segment`) | per leaf vertex: anchor = placement point, axis = leaf forward |
| bloom meshes (`emitBloomMesh`) | per bloom vertex: anchor = the bloom, axis = its normal, from `BloomAnchor::segment` |
| `emitBranchTubes`, `emitScatterSegments` | 12 per kept segment (`appendSegmentVegetation`) |
| `emitFoliageVegetation`, `emitSegmentVegetation` | 16 per leaf / segment instance, in lockstep with the transforms |

bro's side (the wind field, `setWind` / `windAt`, the shaders, the shadow
pass) is documented in bro's `docs/scene-api.js` and `docs/scene-nodes-api.js`
"Vegetation"; the JS surface in bro's `docs/flora-api.js` "Vegetation records".

## Step 2 as built: the look

What changed, and where:

- **Crown clumps** (`include/broflora/clumps.h`, bromesh
  `procedural/leaf_clumps.h`).
  - A plant's leaf mass is a set of clumps picked greedily from its leafy
    twig tips, outermost first, each kept only where it stands clear of the
    others (`ClumpOptions::spacing`), so the silhouette fills first and sky
    shows between clumps.
  - A clump's radius follows its crown; its density follows its twig's
    `foliageDensity` (the density policy now lives in the library, not the
    API).
  - bromesh `placeLeavesInClumps` fills three overlapping lobes per clump,
    leaves in a shell under the lobe surface, facing outward.
  - bro.scene's scatter node does the same on the GPU (`clumps: true`, the
    same hash draws). A leaf's records are its twig tip's, so a clump rides
    its twig.
  - Clumps are the default of every foliage emit; `clumps: false` gives the
    old per-twig spray.
- **Kinked bark** (`Species::kink`, default 0.2). Each node of each module
  steps sideways by a hashed fraction of its edge, accumulated down the
  module tree, in `emitPlantSegments` (and so in every bark, bloom and leaf
  emit).
  - Joints stay closed.
  - Emit only; the simulation never sees the kinks.
- **Joined tubes.** `emitBranchTubes` writes `tangents`, the bisector at each
  joint between a segment and the child that continues it, and the tube
  node mitres its rings on it. A continuation starts at its parent's radius;
  a side shoot starts with a small collar.
- **The rigid-segment seam.** The `emitSegmentVegetation` records are now
  the segment form (`writeSegmentVegetation`): crown floats = tip,
  -(1 + weightTo). The shader interpolates the weight along each instanced
  cylinder, so a segment's tip bends with its child's base.
- **Colour from the records** (bro `vegetationTint`). Each plant leans warm
  or cool, and each limb and leaf varies in value. Leaves deep in the crown
  are darker and cooler, and the rim is lighter. Bark varies by plant. A
  node's colour is the species mean, and the crowns come out varied around
  it.
- **Reach.** A limb's sway grows with plant height, because longer limbs
  sweep further. This makes a 7 m tree's motion read at grove distance.

The grove demo (broworkshop `demos/grove`) has these features:

- uneven, colour-varied ground rising to hills;
- plants standing on it;
- thicker trunks (`pipeExp` 2.0, `leafDiameter` 0.028);
- a darker leaf mean;
- golden-hour haze pushed past the grove;
- an under-the-crown close shot.

**Left for step 3:** the grass node. The meadow is still a coloured
heightfield. Its colour patches are where grass density and hue should come
from.

## Step 3 as built: the grass

- **`scene.createGrass(opts)`** (bro `scene/grass_node.h`,
  `vulkan/shaders/scene_grass.glsl`, `scene_mesh_drawer_grass.cpp`; API in
  bro `docs/scene-nodes-api.js`). Dense's meadow, ported: no per-blade data,
  three rings of cells around the camera (6 cm, 20 cm, 55 cm cells out to
  20 / 55 / 150 m at the default range), each one instanced draw over only
  the cells of its visible sector. Each blade comes from its cell's hash, the
  clump noise and the node's **field**: a grid of ground height, density,
  dryness and a height multiplier that the JS side bakes once from the ground
  (a mesh node's top surface, a terrain, a clipmap or a height function) and
  from `density` / `dry` / `tall`, numbers or functions of (x, z, y).
- **Wind** is the scene's field: the steady lean, a per-blade flutter and the
  travelling gust bands, which lift the sheen of what they bend. A calm
  (`speed 0, gust 0`) is still to the pixel.
- **Light**: blades take most of their shading from the ground's normal
  (bulk 0.72), dark at the root, translucent like leaves (the same mesh.frag
  vegetation path, with the blade's ao and fade in `vegShade.w`), each blade
  its own value and a little hue. Far off, a blade widens and loses its dark
  root and its translucency and is lit as the ground, so a hillside reads as
  turf rather than as a field of bright tips.
- **Movers**: `grass.addMover(node, {radius, strength, trample})` and
  `grass.push(x, z, ...)` stamp a time-stamped influence map (a 102 m window
  of 20 cm cells that follows the camera; sub-rect uploads). The shader decays
  it from the stamp time: blades spring back in about half a second, and
  flattened grass lies the way it was pushed, leaning from the root, paler,
  rising over about 20 s.
- **bro.flora**: `world.groundCover({scale})` is the `density` function for
  grass among grown plants: thin in the crowns' shade (the shadow grid's light
  just above the ground), clear at each trunk.
- **Grove**: the meadow and hills are grass, lush to sun-dried from the same
  patches that colour the (now darker, turf-coloured) soil, thin under the
  trees by `groundCover`. A ball rolls a loop through it as a mover. Shots
  `meadow`, `ground` (in the grass), `parting` and `roller`; `capture.js perf`
  measures the grass's GPU cost.
- **Cost** (1280x720, RTX 4090, perf.gpuFrameMs over 60 frames): the grass is
  1.6 to 2.2 ms of a 12.7 to 13 ms grove frame (10.7 to 11.4 ms without it),
  about 210k / 110k / 100k instances in the three rings.

Still short of dense: close up, the sward is less crowded and less
contrasty than dense's (`r2_walker`, `r2_ground`), partly the golden-hour
light; a flattened lane is visible but quieter than a walker's in dense; the
far ring's sunlit hills still show individual blades rather than a texture;
only the near ring casts shadows, and none by default.

## Order

1. Motion: the wind field, hierarchical sway, bulk normals and translucency in
   bro.scene; broflora emits the sway data; the lab shows it.
2. Look: crown clumps, kinked bark, interior depth, leaf underside.
3. Grass: the grass node on the same wind, parted by movers.

Each step is judged by motion strips and short videos next to the reference
galleries, not by stills.
